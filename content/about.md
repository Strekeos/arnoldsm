Driven by an unwavering passion for innovation and precision, my journey spans over 22+ years of hands-on experience with computers and technology. From exploring a range of design and multimedia tools to delving into both legacy software and modern utilities, my career has been a continuous drive to learn and achieve practical expertise.

I leverage state-of-the-art AI and LLM training techniques to tackle challenges across diverse technical disciplines, always ready to learn and apply new tools as needed. I’m not defined by titles or accolades—if I put my mind to something, I get it done.
