I’m Arnold—a hybrid of spreadsheets and code, auditing financial systems by day and engineering AI tools by night. My career is a Venn diagram: one circle in corporate rigor (BDDK/KGK compliance, HR analytics), the other in chaos (Cappadocia cave hotels, concert production). The overlap? Relentless problem-solving.

Trained in environmental engineering, I dissect data with lab precision. Built software to automate bureaucracy, track employee milestones, and streamline audits—because even compliance can have a brain. Fluent in Turkish, English, and Python.

This space dissects the friction between legacy systems and modern tech. Think AI grafted onto HR workflows, financial data stripped into art, or why managing midnight hotel check-ins sharpens your code-debugging instincts.

Not here for polish. Here for the raw edge of applied curiosity.
