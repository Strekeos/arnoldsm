With 22+ years of hands-on experience in tech, my journey started from sheer curiosity—tinkering with design tools, internet utilities, and whatever software I could get my hands on. That curiosity evolved into a practical mindset: learn fast, adapt quicker, and figure things out as I go. Technology isn’t just a skillset for me—it’s a second language.

My professional path has been as versatile as my interests, spanning financial auditing, HR, data control, and live event production. Each role added new layers to how I approach systems, people, and problem-solving. I’ve worked on the ground and behind the scenes, always looking for smarter, more efficient ways to do things.

Over the years, I’ve taught myself to code—Python, HTML, Java, and more—always with AI by my side as a tool, not a crutch. I experiment with LLMs, build automations, and dive into new tech the moment I need it. I don’t aim to be a master of everything—but if it matters, I’ll learn it and apply it.
